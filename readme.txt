Simple user admin is a WordPress MultiSite plugin that gives site administrators a simpler interface to manage blogs and users.

== Description ==

Simple user admin is a WordPress MultiSite plugin that gives site administrators a simpler interface to manage blogs and users. The plugin allows you to search for users and blogs, see the blogs that a particular user has access to, and users that have access to a particular blog. You can add users to a blog, or add blogs to a user. You can also easily change roles for a user for all their blogs, or change roles for all users of a particular blog.

The plugin also makes use of the __() function to allow for easy translation.

Many thanks to Joost from http://yoast.com/ for fixing the plugin to work with MultiSite. Also thanks to Adam Dunson of http://www.cloudspace.com for lots of development work.

== Installation ==

The plugin should be installed from the WordPress Plugin Repository and activated.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why did you write this plugin? =

To scratch my own itch when developing [BeatsBase.com](http://beatsbase.co.uk "Free mix hosting for DJs") and [Wibsite.com](http://wibsite.com "The worlds most popular Wibsite"). I'd noticed that the usual blog admin screen is pretty flaky when trying to edit users, especially if there are a lot of blog options. Hopefully this plugin helps other developers too.
